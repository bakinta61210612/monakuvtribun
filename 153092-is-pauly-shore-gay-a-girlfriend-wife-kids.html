Speculations of him being gay have arisen partly because of his jokes. Many are curious about his real sexual identity.</p><h3>Pauly Shore: Is he gay?</h3><p class=align-left>The comedian is not gay, judging from his dating history. He has been romantically linked to high-profile women since he came into the limelight.</p><p class=align-left>For many years, there have been rumours that he is a gay man. On 20 September 2017, he incited rumours that he was gay after he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">took to Facebook saying</a> he thought he was gay.</p><p class=align-left>It turned out to be one of his jokes. Some fans claimed he made the social media post to garner public attention because his popularity was dwindling.</p><h3>Who is Pauly Shore's wife?</h3><p class=align-left>The comedian and <a href=#>actor is not</a> married. He has never married and does not have biological kids. However, he has been in romantic relationships with different women.</p><p class=align-left>He is believed to be in a long-term relationship with Alex Noble. The two allegedly started dating in 2014 and have been together for almost a decade.</p><p class=align-left>They were spotted on a Miami beach in 2015 in a public display of affection. There is not much public information about Alex Noble, what she does for a living or how they met.</p><p class=align-left>In the past, he was romantically linked to the women listed below.</p><ul><li>Wafah Dufour (2005)</li><li>Jillian Grace (2004)</li><li>Jewel De’Nyle (2002)</li><li>Kylie Minogue (1997)</li><li>Jill St. Marks (1991)</li><li>Savannah (1991-1992)</li><li>Tiffani Thiessen (1990)</li><li>Deborah Laufer (1988)</li><li>Kina Tavarozi</li><li>Brandy Alexandre</li><li>Belladonna</li><li>Midori</li></ul><h4><strong>Relationship with Shannon Wilsey</strong></h4><p class=align-left>In mid-July 1994, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Shannon Wilsey, alias Savannah</a>, died. She shot herself in the head hours after crashing her white Corvette and injuring her face.</p><p class=align-left>Savannah was an adult film actress. The two dated from 1991 to 1992. The two had already parted ways when she died.</p><p class=align-left>He was with her when she died in St. Joseph’s Hospital in Burbank. Her death shook him and made him work towards shedding his party-boy persona.</p><h3>Is Drew Barrymore engaged to Pauly Shore?</h3><p class=align-left>In early November 2023, the comedian <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">proposed to Drew Barrymore</a> in an episode of <i>Drew Barrymore’s Daytime Talk Show</i>. <a href=#>The show host</a> and her audience were left stunned after he went down on one knee.</p><p class=align-left>The two have been friends for years. On 3 August 2016, Barrymore and art consultant <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Will Kopelman's divorce</a> was finalised.</p><p class=align-left>Before her death, Pauly Shore's mother expressed the desire for her son to marry Barrymore. Referring to his mother's wishes, he went down on one knee and presented her with a ring with a large white jewel at the centre.</p><p class=align-left>While she accepted his proposal and showed off the ring, the two are not engaged in real life. Drew is not in a relationship, while Shore is still in a relationship with Alex Noble.</p><h3>Who are Pauly Shore's children?</h3><p class=align-left>The comedian has no biological children as of 2024. Therefore, speculations about the existence of Pauly Shore's daughter are far-fetched.</p><h3>Pauly Shore's family</h3><p class=align-left>The comedian and actor was born to Sammy and Mitzi Shore. His father was a comedian and the co-founder of The Comedy Store. His mother, now deceased, worked in the store.</p><p class=align-left>He has three siblings. His brothers' names are Peter and Scott.

He has accumulated his wealth from his long-term career in the <a href=#>entertainment</a> industry.</p><h3>Is Pauly D from <i>Jersey Shore </i>gay?</h3><p class=align-left>Many people mistake Pauly Shore for Pauly D from <i>Jersey Shore</i>.
