She was born on April 25, 1984 in Las Vegas. She was raised in Las Vegas with her family, including her Romanian grandmother. She was always interested in comedy and in acting, and she knew that as soon as she graduated from high school she wanted to move to Los Angeles and pursue a career in comedy. She was one person who was certainly happy to make people laugh, and she began performing improve when she was only eight. She was immediately interested in becoming a member of the Groundlings when she moved to LA, so she made it happen. She also became a Straitjacket Society member in LA, and she decided she would audition for Saturday Night Live.</p><p>She did not become a member of the SNL cast at that point in her life, but she was hired as a writer for the show, and it was a huge accomplishment for her. She was happy to have made it that far in her career, and she didn’t want to spend any time wasting it on anything else. Two years after she was hired as a writer for SNL in 2009, she was also given a part on a Comedy Central show called Workaholics. Film directors began to notice her work and wanted her to come star in some of their smaller films, and that is when Jillian Bell became an actress in the movies. She didn’t have any large or notable roles in anything, but she was getting her foot into the door, which was the most important first step for her.</p><p>Since she began her acting career, she’s had some good roles in some famous movies such as “Bridesmaids” and even “22 Jump Street,” which both made a lot of money in the box office and have become hugely famous movies. She had a name in the latter, but she was simply a girl at the shower in the first. It was announced in 2016 that Jillian Bell would begin to star in another Comedy Central series called Idiotsitter, which has gone on to make her almost a household name. The show also stars Gene Russell. She plays the daughter, who is pretty much an idiot and who doesn’t know how to do anything correctly. It’s funny, and she’s making a reputation for herself as a hilarious actress thanks to this role.</p><p>Jillian Bell is not quite a household name yet, but she is working on it with her roles on Comedy Central, where she really shines as a comedic actress. She will continue to accept roles as they come in so that she can increase her net worth and eventually make it as a household name. We expect to see her more often now that she’s becoming a fixture on television. She has no children and no husband that we are aware of at this moment in time.</p><p>Photo by Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGihoqScnq6vecGeo6VlnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjillian-bell-net-worth.html&text=Jillian%20Bell%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjillian-bell-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjillian-bell-net-worth.html&title=Jillian%20Bell%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjillian-bell-net-worth.html&title=Jillian%20Bell%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjillian-bell-net-worth.html&title=Jillian%20Bell%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjillian-bell-net-worth.html&description=Jillian%20Bell%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jonah-hauer-king.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jonah Hauer-King  Celebsgraphy">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./susan-wright-documentary-netflix.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jeff Wright Murder: Investigating the Circumstances Surrounding a Shocking Crime">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
