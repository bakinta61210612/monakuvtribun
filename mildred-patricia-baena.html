From her son. Joseph Baena’s post, she has a Degree in Culinary Arts.</p><p>Mildred served Maria for 20 years as well. Even with Arnold’s occasional affair, she would ask Maria for love advice. Mildred was obsessed with her.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=relationships>Relationships</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=divorce-with-rogelio-baena>Rogelio Baena (ex-husband)</h3><p>Mildred Patricia Baena was initially married to Rogelio Baena in 1997. They were married for ten years.&nbsp;</p><p>Mildred and Rogelio have a daughter together named Jackie Rozo. While in a marriage with him, Patty Baena was actively in an extramarital relationship with Arnold Schwarzenegger.&nbsp;</p><p>The Baena relationship was not going well at the end of their 10th year together. As a result, they separated some weeks after the child, Joseph,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was born</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Rogelio had no idea about his wife’s affair.</p><p>Rogelio was sure that Joseph was not his son but Arnold’s after his sister told him. He even planned to sue the Hollywood star for falsifying the public document.</p><p>Mildred later filed for divorce and ended things with Rogelio in 2008.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=who-is-arnold-schwarzenegger---the-man-with-whom-she-had-an-affair>Arnold Schwarzenegger (extramarital affair)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Arnold-Schwarzenegger.jpg><p>I’m sure everyone knows who Mildred’s lover is. Arnold Schwarzenegger is an Austrian-<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American actor</a>&nbsp;who has starred in more than 70 films and is most famous for the movies titled ‘The Terminator’ and ‘Commando.’</p><p>Arnold was married to Maria Shriver,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an American journalist</a>, during his affair. Currently, he is in a relationship with a physical therapist named Heather Milligan.</p><p>Mildred Baena had an obsession with Maria and wanted to look like her.</p><p>She would put on Maria’s clothes and jewelry. Mildred also shared an intimate relationship with Maria’s husband on her bed.</p><p>Mildred and Arnold had an on-and-off relationship. We would not say it is all Mildred’s fault. As Mildred says, “It takes two to break a relationship.”</p><p>However, Arnold had an equal fault. Maria confronted Mildred after hearing rumors about Joseph’s resemblance to Arnold. During this process, Mildred confessed everything.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, Arnold fired Mildred as a way to save his marriage. Angry and hot-headed for losing her longtime job, Mildred threatened to go public.</p><p>After three months of learning about the lies and the lovechild, Maria left Arnold. They finally divorced in 2017.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=what-event-led-to-fame-for-mildred-patricia-baena>Joseph Baena (son)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Arnold-Schwarzenegger-and-son-Joseph-Baena.jpg><p>Before the controversy hit, Mildred was an ordinary housekeeper at the Brentwood mansion.</p><p>Mildred was very private about her life, and even her long-term affair with Arnold was a secret. She did not want any negative attention from the media and her and Arnold’s family. Or Mildred did not want to risk losing her job.</p><p>Joseph started resembling the physical attributes of his father as he grew older. It led to suspicion from Arnold’s close friends and family. Maria also doubted the boy’s paternity, so she asked Mildred face-to-face.</p><p>Fourteen years later, Mildred could not bear it anymore and confessed to Maria that Joseph was Arnold’s son. After this event, Mildred was the face and the name on every entertainment headline. In addition, many news channels and publications interviewed her.</p><p>And people knew Mildred as Arnold’s mistress.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Joseph-Baena-childhood-photo-with-his-mother-Mildred-Patricia-Baena-.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=controversies>Controversies</h2><p>Mildred got her fame from controversies in the first place. The most significant one was, being the baby mama of actor Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p><p>She fueled headlines by saying that she hoped for Arnold and Maria’s reconciliation. and sometimes by saying that SHE was ‘more of a wife to Arnold than Maria.’</p><p>In 2011, Rogelio Baena planned to sue Mildred and Arnold for falsifying a public document. It was a severe crime in California and would result in jail time.</p><p>Mildred also got involved in one of Arnold’s controversies. It had something to do with his tell-all biography. In his memoir, he mentioned having years of an affair with his housekeeper, Mildred.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=mildred-patricia-baena-career>Career</h2><p>How she came to the United States from Guatemala is not known.</p><p>We know that she has been a housemaid to Arnold Schwarzenegger and his family since the 1970s. She served them for 20 years until she got fired.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=the-net-worth-of-mildred-patricia-baena>The net worth of Mildred Patricia Baena</h2><p>The exact amount of Mildred Patricia Baena’s net worth is unknown. Nevertheless, reports have that Arnold paid her $5,000 when the lovechild’s news surfaced in the media.</p><p>We also believe that Mildred gained some money for child support from Arnold. According to the law, average child support from a high net-worth individual would be $15,000 to $30,000 a month.</p><p>In 2011/12, Arnold paid around $60,000 – $65000 for Mildred and her son’s house in Bakersfield, California. And all these were before the scandal broke out in the media.</p><p>We don’t know how much she earned as a housekeeper for Schwarzenegger. But, after getting fired, she made her share by giving ‘exclusive news’ to any media that offered to pay her.</p><p>Overall, she is a well-off woman now who does not need to struggle for money or even get a job again to sustain herself.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=mildred-patricia-baena-social-media>Social media</h2><p>Mildred used to own a Myspace page entitled ‘My Sexy Self.’ She stopped using it after getting heavy criticism from people. Mildred also thought it would affect Arnold and her son’s reputation.</p><p>You can find several accounts under her name on Facebook. But they may be fake. She is not active on social media, even though she has an account on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>.</p><p>If you are curious, you should follow her son, Joseph Baena</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=where-is-arnold-schwarzeneggers-baby-mama-mildred-patricia-baena-now>Mildred Patricia Baena now</h2><p>Mildred resides in Bakersfield, California. She lives her retired life in the house that Arnold Schwarzenegger bought.</p><p>Mildred lives there with her partner, Alex Aguiar, and her son, Joseph Baena. She has a very close relationship with her son. People see them cooking and having laid-back family times on their son’s social media accounts.</p><p>In 2017, Mildred graduated from culinary school to fulfill her dream as a chef. Thus, we can say that no matter how controversial Mildred’s life was, she finally found the right spot.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo6%2FRoquim6NjsLC5jqagpZyimrFuvMCtqaKbmZZ6o63Ep5ho</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmildred-patricia-baena.html&text=Mildred%20Patricia%20Baena%3a%20The%20housekeeper%20with%20who%20Arnold%20had%20affair&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmildred-patricia-baena.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmildred-patricia-baena.html&title=Mildred%20Patricia%20Baena%3a%20The%20housekeeper%20with%20who%20Arnold%20had%20affair" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmildred-patricia-baena.html&title=Mildred%20Patricia%20Baena%3a%20The%20housekeeper%20with%20who%20Arnold%20had%20affair" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmildred-patricia-baena.html&title=Mildred%20Patricia%20Baena%3a%20The%20housekeeper%20with%20who%20Arnold%20had%20affair" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmildred-patricia-baena.html&description=Mildred%20Patricia%20Baena%3a%20The%20housekeeper%20with%20who%20Arnold%20had%20affair" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./moonstruck-actress-who-played-mollies-mother-rosie-in-look-whos-talking-2-wds-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Moonstruck actress who played Mollie's mother Rosie in Look Who's Talking: 2 wds.">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./maggie-siff.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Maggie Siff: Age, Height, Husband, Kids, Career, Net worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
