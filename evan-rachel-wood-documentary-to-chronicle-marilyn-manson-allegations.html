But in the aftermath of Wood’s allegations — which opened the floodgates of other Manson accusers — his label, agent, manager and longtime publicist dropped him. Since then, Manson has been the subject of investigations by the Los Angeles Times and Rolling Stone.</p><p>In an interview this week, Berg said that Wood — whom she’d known for years through friends — approached her in 2019 about the film that would turn out to be “Phoenix Rising.” At the time, Berg felt that she wasn’t ready to take it on herself, but helped Wood film as she mounted her Phoenix Act campaign in California, and even sought out other potential directors for the documentary. When COVID-19 hit and everything shut down in spring 2020, Berg changed her mind and decided she wanted to helm the project herself.</p><p>“It wasn’t about Marilyn Manson, and his whole world,” Berg said of the origins of the project. “This was about an Erin Brockovich story. We were really focused on telling a story about empowerment, something that would offer resources for women and men who are stuck in abusive situations. And that was what we were making — until she decided to name him publicly.”</p><p>Berg and Wood — along with, Berg said, “a number of survivors” whom they were filming even before Wood accused Manson — were in production during COVID with a small crew. “It’s a really intimate portrait of Evan, and I had incredible access,” Berg said.</p><p>HBO officially signed onto the project in summer 2020. That September, Berg said Wood decided to accuse Manson after his new album came out, and her veiled allegations against him over the years resurfaced. “People started responding on Twitter, standing in support of Evan,” Berg said. They also learned of an FBI investigation into the singer, which other Manson accusers have&nbsp;also cited&nbsp;— though it’s never been officially confirmed, Berg claims that it’s ongoing.</p><p>Part 1 of the documentary ends during that time, with Part 2 — which Berg is still working on — focusing on Wood’s decision to come forward and the aftermath of that choice.</p><p>“Naming Manson obviously created a lot more story for us. It became a two-part film in the edit bay,” Berg said.</p><p>“Phoenix Rising” is a full portrait of Wood, delving into her family life and her career beginnings as a child actor — “and how she was forced into adulthood from such young age — like ‘Thirteen,’ and those roles,” Berg said.</p><p>“She’s so candid with us,” Berg said. “And it’s very personal.”</p><p><h2 id=optional-screen-reader class=lrv-a-screen-reader-only>optional screen reader</h2><h4 class="o-nav__title lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-font-family-secondary o-nav__title a-content-ignore u-line-height-140 u-letter-spacing-0002">Read More About:</h4></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tonaaWu26%2BwJyfnqRdrLywsIydppytnZq7ta3RsmStp12YtbO7zaKapZ1doq6ztcuypWalkaPAsLqMmqOlnZeWwaq7zaxm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fevan-rachel-wood-documentary-to-chronicle-marilyn-manson-allegations.html&text=Evan%20Rachel%20Wood%20Documentary%20to%20Chronicle%20Marilyn%20Manson%20Allegations&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fevan-rachel-wood-documentary-to-chronicle-marilyn-manson-allegations.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fevan-rachel-wood-documentary-to-chronicle-marilyn-manson-allegations.html&title=Evan%20Rachel%20Wood%20Documentary%20to%20Chronicle%20Marilyn%20Manson%20Allegations" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fevan-rachel-wood-documentary-to-chronicle-marilyn-manson-allegations.html&title=Evan%20Rachel%20Wood%20Documentary%20to%20Chronicle%20Marilyn%20Manson%20Allegations" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fevan-rachel-wood-documentary-to-chronicle-marilyn-manson-allegations.html&title=Evan%20Rachel%20Wood%20Documentary%20to%20Chronicle%20Marilyn%20Manson%20Allegations" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fevan-rachel-wood-documentary-to-chronicle-marilyn-manson-allegations.html&description=Evan%20Rachel%20Wood%20Documentary%20to%20Chronicle%20Marilyn%20Manson%20Allegations" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./frankie-flowers-arrested-and-charged-is-he-in-jail.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Frankie Flowers Arrested and Charged: Is He in Jail?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./maddie-completes-30-days-at-springtime-meadows-on-tonights-season-finale-of-recovery-road-watch-a-sneak-peek.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="EMMA FASSLER, SEBASTIAN DE SOUZA, DAVID WITTS  Celeb Secrets">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
