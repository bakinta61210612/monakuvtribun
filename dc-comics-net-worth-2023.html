The company’s primary goal is to become a comic book publishing franchise. The franchise began with the release of “New Fun: The Big Comic-Magazine #1,” a tabloid-sized publication in 1935. Later on, this comic series was renamed More Fun Comics.</p><p>Unlike other publishing companies, this one specialized in superhero comic books. The franchise’s founder launched his Detective Comic in 1937, which went on to become the longest-running comic series of all time and was the inspiration for the company’s name. Another anthology, Action Comics, was published in 1938, ushering in a new decade of superhero comic books.</p><p>The franchise has also pioneered new creative concepts in comic books, which have been enormously successful and well-received by fans worldwide. This is the first comic book publishing franchise to own the entire Superman comic series, as well as the first to introduce to their comic books a female character named Lois Lane, Superman’s romantic interest.</p><p>The franchise had made significant progress over the years. The problem arose when Fox Comics began producing knockoffs of their superheroes. After the popularity of superheroes waned in the 1940s, the company shifted its emphasis to other genres such as romance, science fiction, westerns, and comedy.</p><p>Later, in superheroes such as Justice League, a new and intriguing concept of character association was introduced. During this time, the franchise faced a major rival in the form of Marvel Comics.</p><p>Since then, the publishing house has worked hard to introduce a slew of new and innovative comic books. The DC Comics Company employs a talented and creative workforce that has contributed to the franchise’s success across all genres.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DC-Comics-1.jpg alt="DC Comics networth" width=600 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Net Worth And Earnings Of DC Comics In 2023</h2><p><strong>DC Comics</strong> is the most well-known name in the world of comic books.
