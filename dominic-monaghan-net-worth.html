While it might be hard to accept, some of our favorite celebrities must endure numerous rejections before landing a good role that allows them to climb the success ladder.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Dominic began his career starring in television shows and films such as </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Hetty Wainthropp Investigates, Hostile Waters, This is Personal: The Hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>and&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Monsignor Renard.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dominic-Monaghan-Net-Worth.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The actor gradually rose to fame when he played Charlie Pace on the ABC drama&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Lost</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>. Dominic was initially paid around $36,000 for his role, however, his salary <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">was later increased to</a> around $80,000 for each episode.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Following this, he starred in&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>100 Code, A Midsummer’s Nightmare</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, and&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Bite Club</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>. So, it is safe to assume that Dominic Monaghan’s fortune must have improved over time from appearing on television.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Earnings_From_Movies></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Earnings From Movies</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Along with a successful television acting career, Dominic ventured out into acting in films, accumulating a massive fortune in the process. Here are <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">some of the movies</a> in which the actor has appeared, along with their box office earnings:</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><table id=detail_table><tr><th>Title</th><th>Box Office Earnings</th><th>Years</th></tr><tbody><tr><td>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</td><td>$897.7 million</td><td>2001</td></tr><tr><td>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</td><td>$947.5 million</td><td>2002</td></tr><tr><td>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</td><td>$373.1 million</td><td>2009</td></tr><tr><td>Soldiers of Fortune</td><td>$1.572 million</td><td>2012</td></tr><tr><td>The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies</td><td>$962.2 million</td><td>2014</td></tr><tr><td>Atomica</td><td>$100 million</td><td>2017</td></tr><tr><td>Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker</td><td>$1.074 billion</td><td>2019</td></tr></tbody></table></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>There is no doubt that Monaghan’s earnings from the films mentioned above are enormous. Furthermore, other LOTR stars such as <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Elijah Wood</strong></a> and <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Sean Astin</strong></a> made around $250,000 from the film’s first installment. Given that he had similar roles in the films to theirs, Dominic Monaghan’s salary might have also been in the same range.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The actor has had the good fortune to work in several big-budget films and television series over the years. Dominic must have amassed a massive amount by portraying important characters in such series and movies.</span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Income_From_Producing></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Income From Producing&nbsp;</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Unsatisfied with just acting, Dominic has also ventured into producing.

The average salary of a film producer in the United States is around $72,115 per year. So, t<span data-preserver-spaces=true>here is no doubt that Dominic Monaghan’s net worth benefited from his work as a producer.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Has_A_Podcast></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Has A Podcast</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>With <strong>J.
