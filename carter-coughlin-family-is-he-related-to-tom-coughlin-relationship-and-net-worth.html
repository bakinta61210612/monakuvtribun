Learn more about their family and the variances in their net worth. Carter Coughlin is a linebacker with the New York Giants in the National Football League (NFL). He was drafted by the Giants in the seventh round of the 2020 NFL Draft after playing college football for Minnesota.</p><p>Coughlin appeared in 11 games as a true freshman and collected 25 tackles, including four tackles for loss and two sacks. Furthermore, the football linebacker had the most positive approach to his game, and his commitment and hard work are seen in his performances.&nbsp;He was named All-Big Ten Conference honorable mention after leading the Golden Gophers with 11.5 tackles for loss and 6.5 sacks in his second season as an outside linebacker. Coughlin was also put on injured reserve on November 1, 2021.</p><h2>Is Carter Coughlin Related To Tom Coughlin?</h2><p>Football fans are outraged to learn the answer to the question,<strong> “Is Carter Coughlin related to Tom Coughlin?</strong>” Let’s get to the bottom of this.&nbsp;Tom Coughlin, born Thomas Richard Coughlin, is a former football coach and executive in the United States.&nbsp;From 2004 until 2015, he was the head coach of the New York Giants. He guided the Giants to victories against the New England Patriots in Super Bowls XLII and XLVI.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Carter-Coughlin-1.jpg alt="Carter Coughlin" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Furthermore, since they had the same last name, speculations of them being related proliferated. It is often assumed that persons with similar surnames are related.&nbsp;However, in this situation, this view is shown to be incorrect. Despite their shared love of football and having the same last name, they are not related. Furthermore, due to these similarities, their fans want to know whether Carter Coughlin is connected to Tom Coughlin. They are not, however, connected in any way. Despite their similarities, they are unrelated. However, both of them have had a successful career.&nbsp;Furthermore, the similarities between them were entirely accidental.</p><h2>Carter Coughlin’s Family History</h2><p><strong>Carter Coughlin</strong> was born on July 21, 1997, in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, to Robert Coughlin and Jennie Mow.&nbsp;Carter hails from an athletic family, having a tennis player mother and a football player father.&nbsp;His grandpa, Tom Moe, was a football player for the Gophers from 1957 to 1959. Mike Moe, his uncle, played football with the Gophers in 1980. He came from an athletic household and was always interested in sports as a child.</p><p>In addition, Coughlin has four siblings, two brothers and two sisters. Cullen, one of his brothers, and Callie, his sister, are both adopted.&nbsp;Carter attended Eden Prairie High School and participated in basketball and football. He helped lead the Eagles to back-to-back state titles as a sophomore and junior.</p><h2>Tom Coughlin and Carter Coughlin Net Worth Difference</h2><p>Carter and Tom, both of whom have had professional football careers, must have made a god living.&nbsp;Carter is a well-known football player who has gained widespread acclaim for his game performances.&nbsp;His net worth fluctuates between $1 million and $5 million, demonstrating his undying passion and devotion to football.&nbsp;Tom Coughlin’s annual pay as a head coach is $7 million. However, as of 2023, his net worth is estimated to be approximately $16 million.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tom-Coughlin.jpg alt="Tom Coughlin" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>There is a significant disparity in net worth between the two football fans. Carter, on the other hand, has just recently begun his career and will have much more to accomplish in the coming days.&nbsp;As a result, if he continues to perform well, he will undoubtedly enhance his net worth in the following years.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiamqqkmr9ur86unqGkmaN6p63MoqOyZZmoeqmxjKucpZmkmrFuwM5mq6ilXZi8trPHpaCnZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXqiusNmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcarter-coughlin-family-is-he-related-to-tom-coughlin-relationship-and-net-worth.html&text=Carter%20Coughlin%20Family%3a%20Is%20He%20Related%20To%20Tom%20Coughlin%3f%20Relationship%20And%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcarter-coughlin-family-is-he-related-to-tom-coughlin-relationship-and-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcarter-coughlin-family-is-he-related-to-tom-coughlin-relationship-and-net-worth.html&title=Carter%20Coughlin%20Family%3a%20Is%20He%20Related%20To%20Tom%20Coughlin%3f%20Relationship%20And%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcarter-coughlin-family-is-he-related-to-tom-coughlin-relationship-and-net-worth.html&title=Carter%20Coughlin%20Family%3a%20Is%20He%20Related%20To%20Tom%20Coughlin%3f%20Relationship%20And%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcarter-coughlin-family-is-he-related-to-tom-coughlin-relationship-and-net-worth.html&title=Carter%20Coughlin%20Family%3a%20Is%20He%20Related%20To%20Tom%20Coughlin%3f%20Relationship%20And%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcarter-coughlin-family-is-he-related-to-tom-coughlin-relationship-and-net-worth.html&description=Carter%20Coughlin%20Family%3a%20Is%20He%20Related%20To%20Tom%20Coughlin%3f%20Relationship%20And%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./charlie-mcveigh-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Charlie Mcveigh Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./buddy-boeheim-wiki-family-girlfriend.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Buddy Boeheim Wiki, Girlfriend, Age, Brother, Family &amp;amp; Facts">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
