Since that time, she has been cast in several Nigerian movies, some of which are:</span></p><ul><li>Open and Close</li><li>Tears in My Heart 1 & 2</li><li>Wife on the Loose</li><li>Instagram Hustlers</li><li>Bobrisky in Love</li><li>Five Sisters</li><li>Unfaithful Wife</li><li>Real Fake Babes</li><li>Wife Vs.

Her over a decade and a half acting career trajectory have seen her rise to stardom as one of Nollywood’s finest and most resourceful actresses. </span><span>She is extremely talented and is famed for her uncanny ability to morph into diverse characters as required and expertly deliver given roles. Anita has once received an Africa Magic Viewers Choice Award as Actress of The Year.</span></p><h2><strong>What else does She do Apart from Acting?</strong></h2><p>Like many actors and actresses in the Nigerian entertainment industry and indeed celebrities in the country and worldwide, Anita has diversified her income sources by investing in businesses and leveraging her good public image to promote brands (their products and services) who can foot her bill.</p><h3><strong>She is a Businesswoman</strong></h3><p><span>Aside from her burgeoning acting career, Anita Joseph is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Hourglass Fashion World, a retail store for waist trainers, gym belts, butt lifters, and other figure enhancement accessories. The brand is familiar to many high-class women who want to get a finely curved waist. And looking at the actress who is everything curvy you would desire in a woman, she readily uses herself to advertise the efficacy of her merchandise.</span></p><h3><strong>Anita is a Brand Promoter and Ambassador</strong></h3><p><span>She is currently an influencer for several fashion and beauty brands, including Glee Skincare, Bodybyenniie, Cupid8 Empire, Rhiks Hair, etc. She readily promotes all these brands on her social media profiles to her teeming fans, who hardly cease to comment on the posts.</span></p><h2><strong>Anita is Married to MC Fish and is a Mother of Two</strong></h2><p><span>Anita Joseph is married to the 30-year-old hype man, comedian, and Master of Ceremonies Michael Fisayo Olagunju, professionally known as MC Fish. They held their English-style wedding on the 14th of February, 2020. The actress took to her Instagram page the same day to express love for her groom and excitement at the prospect of spending forever with him.&nbsp;</span></p><p>However, before her marriage with the celebrated MC, Anita Joseph had a daughter named Chizaram Isabella Carter Joseph. She gave birth to her in December 2015, but the paternity of the child is currently unknown. Aside from her daughter, which there are pictures on the internet to ascertain that she does exist, Anita is also said to have a son named Michael, which speculation is yet to be denied or confirmed by her. The boy is about 12 years old, as he is believed to have been born in 2011.</p><p><span>Though now married, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>several speculations</a> and controversies have surrounded Anita’s love life in the past. For instance, she is said to have been in a customary marriage with a certain businessman based in Abia State. The man’s name and his other personal information are undisclosed to date. The marriage reportedly lasted for about three years and ended childlessly.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><strong>Anita Joseph’s Popularity and Social Media Presence</strong></h3><p><span>Anita has a large following on Instagram, currently numbering just over two million, which explains the heavy patronage she receives as a brand ambassador. She is fondly called “Mother Hen” among her fans for her love and support for Nigerian crossdresser <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Bobrisky</a>. She has publicly defended him on social media against critics, even once threatening to block any of her followers who dare to speak against him.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pjimage-2.jpg><p><span>Anita is also friends with 2019 ex-BBNaija housemate Alex (Asogwa Alexandra A) and also 2020 ex-BBNaija housemate <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Laycon</a> (Olamilekan Moshood Agbeleshe), who she supported massively </span><span>in the last season of the popular Nigerian reality TV show.</span></p><p><span>She has been labeled controversial among fans and critics due to her speculated history with men. Her racy Instagram pictures, videos, and comments about her relationship with her husband, MC Fish, have also given people a lot to talk about. Once, she made a post expressing regrets about her six body ink marks, saying that she was not aware that tattooing was sinful when she was inscribing them.</span></p><p><span>This, too, caused a bit of a stir among her fans. </span><span>Despite all of these, Anita Joseph continues to maintain a healthy and acceptable public image. She remains a screen favorite for many Nigerian movie enthusiasts.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK5706GcZquTpLyxec6nZJqmmamubrbOrJypoKNiv6aty2aYoJ1dlruleceeqWaepaG5bq7IqJ6rmaCdxnA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-scoop-on-anita-josephs-real-age-and-her-full-biography.html&text=Anita%20Joseph%20Biography%20and%20Age&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-scoop-on-anita-josephs-real-age-and-her-full-biography.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-scoop-on-anita-josephs-real-age-and-her-full-biography.html&title=Anita%20Joseph%20Biography%20and%20Age" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-scoop-on-anita-josephs-real-age-and-her-full-biography.html&title=Anita%20Joseph%20Biography%20and%20Age" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-scoop-on-anita-josephs-real-age-and-her-full-biography.html&title=Anita%20Joseph%20Biography%20and%20Age" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-scoop-on-anita-josephs-real-age-and-her-full-biography.html&description=Anita%20Joseph%20Biography%20and%20Age" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./below-decks-hannah-ferrier-where-is-she-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Below Deck's Hannah Ferrier: Where is she now?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ammika-harris-reveals-the-dream-life-in-a-photo-478929.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ammika Harris Reveals The Dream Life In A Photo">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
