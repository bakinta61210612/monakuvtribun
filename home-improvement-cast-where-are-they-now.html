Even though the series’ final episode debuted in 1999, the cast is still hugely popular 20 years after the show’s debut. People are naturally curious about the present whereabouts and activities of their favourite actors, and we are here to provide those answers!</p><h3>Where is Tim Allen Now?</h3><p><br>Tim Allen, who played the role of Timothy “Tim” Taylor in the ABC series, is our first interviewee. The performer continues to be well-liked and is well-known for playing Buzz Lightyear in the “Toy Story” film series. He has also won recognition for his work as a voice actor. Aside from his work in “More Power” and “Assembly Required,” his current appearance as Scott Calvin/Santa Claus in “The Santa Clauses” has also contributed to his increased fame. Allen and Jane Hajduk have been wed since October 7, 2006, and Allen is the father of Katherine and Elizabeth. He will be performing in most significant American cities while on a current nationwide comedy tour.</p><h3>Where is Patricia Richardson Now?</h3>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Patricia Richardson (@prichardsonla)</a></p><p><br>The actor Patricia Richardson, who played Jillian “Jill” Taylor in “Home Improvement,” is up next. She has remained a vital component of the entertainment business over the years as an actor and was most recently seen in “Grey’s Anatomy” as Tessa Hobbes. She plays Maddie in the movie “Country Line: No Fear.” As of the time of writing, Patricia is the mother of Ray Baker’s three children from her previous marriage: Henry, Roxanne, and Joseph Baker. In actuality, Roxanne appears to have wed in or around June 2023, and Henry is a proud father to one child.</p><h3>How Did Earl Hindman Die?<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wilson-e1687639487573-1.jpg alt="home improvement lisa,cast of home improvement then and now,home improvement cast deaths,which kid from home improvement killed himself,which kid on home improvement died,mark from home improvement now,how did randy die on home improvement,tim the tool man cast neighbor,home improvement where are they now,home improvement cast where are they now,cast of home improvement where are they now 2018,home improvement cast died,home improvement show where are they now" width=960 height=641 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>We regret to inform you of the demise of Earl Hindman, who achieved considerable fame for playing Wilson W. Wilson Jr. on the ABC sitcom. He continued to work in the entertainment sector and participated in a number of television shows before passing away. But the actor died of lung cancer on December 29, 2003, in Stamford, Connecticut. He was married to Molly McGreevy at the time.</p><h3>Where is Taran Noah Smith Now?</h3>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Taran Noah Smith (@taran.noah.smith)</a></p><p><br>Marcus Jason “Mark” Taylor, played by actor Taran Noah Smith, was a part of the popular comedy series for all eight seasons. He began working in the entertainment sector at an early age and quit performing in the 1990s, though he continued to be involved in various capacities for a few more years. Smith currently works as an Integration Technician with SpaceX out of Los Angeles, California. Although the former TV star is not very active on social media, his career successes undoubtedly point to a fulfilling existence.</p><h3>Where is Jonathan Taylor Thomas Now?<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Jon-1-1.jpg alt="home improvement lisa,cast of home improvement then and now,home improvement cast deaths,which kid from home improvement killed himself,which kid on home improvement died,mark from home improvement now,how did randy die on home improvement,tim the tool man cast neighbor,home improvement where are they now,home improvement cast where are they now,cast of home improvement where are they now 2018,home improvement cast died,home improvement show where are they now" width=960 height=640 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>Another actor who played Randall William “Randy” Taylor in the ABC series while he was a child was Jonathan Taylor Thomas. Although the performer appeared to take a sabbatical from the entertainment industry in the 2000s, his playing and directing roles in “Last Man Standing” allowed him to return in 2013. He voiced a young Simba in the 1994 film “The Lion King,” which is among his most well-known performances from his career in the performing industry. We are confident that Thomas is having a happy life away from the spotlight even though he doesn’t seem to be very active on social media.</p><h3>Where is Zachery Ty Bryan Now?<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bryan-1.jpg alt="home improvement lisa,cast of home improvement then and now,home improvement cast deaths,which kid from home improvement killed himself,which kid on home improvement died,mark from home improvement now,how did randy die on home improvement,tim the tool man cast neighbor,home improvement where are they now,home improvement cast where are they now,cast of home improvement where are they now 2018,home improvement cast died,home improvement show where are they now" width=960 height=640 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>Zachery Ty Bryan is well-known for playing Bradley Michael “Brad” Taylor in the television series “Home Improvement,” but he has continued to work in the industry. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift and THOR: Hammer of the Gods are two of his most renowned works.

Numerous accusations claim that Bryan has defrauded victims out of a total of around $50,000. He currently resides in Oregon with Johnnie Faye, and in November 2022, the couple announced that they were expecting twins. Bryan is currently a parent to seven children, including his two youngest.</p><h3>Where is Richard Karn Now?</h3>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Richard Karn (@officialrichardkarn)</a></p><p><br>Richard Karn’s efforts to the entertainment industry have made him a household figure thanks to his portrayal of Albert “Al” Borland.

She has had appearances in a number of television shows throughout the years, including “Boy Meets World” and “Wicked Wicked Games.” She wed Steve Timmons in 1997, however the pair later divorced; the process was concluded in 2018. Spencer, Stoney, and Sysco are their three children collectively; the latter graduated from eighth grade in June 2023.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c9c5dc8e24ec8d74ae07e882d4c2212b?s=150&d=mp&r=g" height=150 width=150 itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Ayushi S</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><ul><li>Ayushi S https://dotcomstories.com/author/ayushi-s/ <i class=m-a-icon-doc></i> <a class=molongui-remove-underline href=#><span>Best Chick Flicks on HBO Max Right Now: Your Guide to Romantic Movie Nights</span></a></li><li>Ayushi S https://dotcomstories.com/author/ayushi-s/ <i class=m-a-icon-doc></i> <a class=molongui-remove-underline href=#><span>Vanessa Papa The Ultimatum: A Recap of the Drama-Unfolding Reality Show</span></a></li><li>Ayushi S https://dotcomstories.com/author/ayushi-s/ <i class=m-a-icon-doc></i> <a class=molongui-remove-underline href=#><span>Best Indian Shows on Netflix: Exploring Rich and Diverse Cultural Narratives</span></a></li><li>Ayushi S https://dotcomstories.com/author/ayushi-s/ <i class=m-a-icon-doc></i> <a class=molongui-remove-underline href=#><span>Best PG-13 Movies on Netflix: Family-Friendly Entertainment for Various Tastes</span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmicn6mwsLnSraaroZWoe6S7zGifqKWVYrauvNGorZ6llaPBbq%2FArKtmr5iav6Z5wKucZqyYmsZuus6wZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhome-improvement-cast-where-are-they-now.html&text=Home%20Improvement%20Cast%3a%20Where%20Are%20They%20Now%3f%20Catching%20Up%20with%20the%20Beloved%20TV%20Shows%20Stars&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhome-improvement-cast-where-are-they-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhome-improvement-cast-where-are-they-now.html&title=Home%20Improvement%20Cast%3a%20Where%20Are%20They%20Now%3f%20Catching%20Up%20with%20the%20Beloved%20TV%20Shows%20Stars" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhome-improvement-cast-where-are-they-now.html&title=Home%20Improvement%20Cast%3a%20Where%20Are%20They%20Now%3f%20Catching%20Up%20with%20the%20Beloved%20TV%20Shows%20Stars" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhome-improvement-cast-where-are-they-now.html&title=Home%20Improvement%20Cast%3a%20Where%20Are%20They%20Now%3f%20Catching%20Up%20with%20the%20Beloved%20TV%20Shows%20Stars" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhome-improvement-cast-where-are-they-now.html&description=Home%20Improvement%20Cast%3a%20Where%20Are%20They%20Now%3f%20Catching%20Up%20with%20the%20Beloved%20TV%20Shows%20Stars" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./i-have-a-questions-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="I have a ___ questions ...">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./hank-aaron.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hank Aaron- Wiki, Age, Ethnicity, Wife, Height, Net Worth, Career">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
