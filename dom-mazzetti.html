He and his friends used to drink almost every day and play “Halo” and other Xbox games, which is when he got the inspiration for his sketches.</p><p>Mike, as we all know, is extremely private about his personal life. He has been in a long-term relationship with his girlfriend, graphic designer Lee Marie Deming. The lovely couple met for the first time at the gym, fell in love right away, and have been dating ever since. Lee works for Trainor Associates as a digital marketing manager.</p><p>Ke and Gan had been friends since their elementary school days.</p><p>They first met in second grade, and their friendship has lasted beyond their college lives and into their professional lives as well.
