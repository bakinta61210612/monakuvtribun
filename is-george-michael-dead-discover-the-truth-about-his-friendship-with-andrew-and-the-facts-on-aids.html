Such influence and impact led to his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the UK Music Hall of Fame.</p><p>Born in East Finchley, Middlesex, George Michael rose to fame as part of the music duo Wham!</p><p>Their albums “Fantastic” (1983) and “Make It Big” (1984) topped both the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200.</p><p>Notably, Wham!’s hit singles, like “Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go” and the beloved holiday classic “Last Christmas,” solidified their global popularity.</p><p>Their groundbreaking tour of China in 1985 marked the first visit by a Western pop act and garnered widespread media attention.</p><p>George Michael’s immense talent, musical achievements, and contributions to popular culture have firmly established him as a legendary figure in the music industry, celebrated by fans worldwide.</p><h2><span id=Is_George_Michael_Dead>Is George Michael Dead?</span></h2><p>The world mourned the loss of George Michael, the immensely talented singer known for his solo career and earlier days with Wham!.</p><p>On 25th December 2016, the artist, aged 53, peacefully passed away at his home in Goring, Oxfordshire.</p><p>His publicist confirmed that George Michael died of heart failure.</p><p>Andrew Ridgeley, his former bandmate from Wham!, expressed profound devastation at the loss of his beloved friend, whom he affectionately called “Yog.” Ridgeley conveyed heartfelt condolences to Michael’s loved ones, friends, the music community, and the world at large.</p><p>Sir Elton John took to Instagram, sharing a poignant picture of himself with Michael, expressing shock and deep sorrow over the departure of his cherished friend—a kind, generous soul and a brilliant artist.</p><p>He extended sympathies to George Michael’s family and fans.</p><p>The singer’s family, through their spokesperson, released a statement acknowledging his passing and appealed for privacy during this difficult and emotional time.</p><p>They expressed immense sadness and announced that no further comments would be made at this stage.</p><h2><span id=Did_George_Michael_and_Andrew_Stay_Friends>Did George Michael and Andrew Stay Friends?</span></h2><p>Even after Wham disbanded, George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley remained unwavering friends until George’s untimely demise on Christmas Day in 2016.</p><p>Their friendship had flourished long before their musical partnership and continued to thrive even after.</p><p>Contrary to rumors of discord during the band’s breakup, George clarified the situation, describing it as “the most amicable split in pop history.”</p><p>Their farewell concert, “The Final,” held at Wembley Stadium on June 28, 1986, witnessed an astounding crowd of 72,000 fans, marking their electrifying last performance together.</p><p>Following the split, George confided in Andrew about his personal struggles.</p><p>In his autobiography, “Wham! George & Me,” Andrew recounted George’s battle with self-doubt and the search for his true identity post-Wham.</p><p>Despite the end of their band, George and Andrew remained close friends, as they had been before embarking on their musical journey together.</p><p>Andrew candidly expressed in his book, “There was a sense that our relationship would never be the same again, irrespective of what lay ahead.</p><p>Life was bound to change significantly for both of us, having spent the previous ten years as schoolmates and then bandmates.”</p><p>In a heartfelt tribute at the 2017 Brit Awards, Andrew emphasized the extraordinary bond they shared, underscoring the profound and remarkable relationship they had nurtured over the years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/een8jo53vqo.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/George-Michael-and-Andrew-Ridgeley.png><h2><span id=Did_George_Michael_have_Aids>Did George Michael have Aids?</span></h2><p>George Michael’s former partner tragically succumbed to AIDS in March 1993, although George’s death was not AIDS-related.</p><p>According to The Mirror, George met Anselmo Feleppa, a Brazilian fashion designer, at the Rock in Rio festival in January 1991, which marked a significant turning point in the singer’s acceptance of his homosexuality.</p><p>Their relationship quickly intensified, with memorable vacations to destinations such as Cyprus and Greece, including visits to George’s residences.</p><p>Anselmo had the privilege of attending George’s four concerts at Wembley Arena.</p><p>However, their joyful time together shattered when Anselmo received a positive HIV test result, initially keeping it a secret due to shame.</p><p>Despite testing negative himself, George reflected on the devastating news, saying, “Try to imagine that you’ve finally found real love and, six months in, it’s devastated. In 1991, it was really terrifying news.”</p><p>Despite the heartbreak, George and Anselmo spent most of the year in Los Angeles, where George was deeply engrossed in his recording work.</p><p>Before Anselmo returned to Brazil to visit his family, they shared one final trip to the Caribbean to celebrate New Year’s Eve.</p><p>Tragically, Anselmo fell ill and passed away during his visit. The following day, George came out to his parents as gay and immediately flew to Brazil to pay his respects at Anselmo’s grave.</p><h2><span id=How_Did_George_Michael_Die>How Did George Michael Die?</span></h2><p>The cause of George Michael’s death has been determined as natural, resulting from dilated cardiomyopathy with myocarditis and fatty liver, according to the Oxfordshire coroner’s statement.</p><p>Following the post-mortem report, it was concluded that no further inquiries or inquest were necessary, leading to the discontinuation of the investigation.</p><p>The family has respectfully requested privacy during this difficult time.</p><p>George’s representative, Michael Lipmann, conveyed their deep sadness and confirmed that he peacefully passed away at home during the Christmas period.</p><p>On the morning of December 25, 2016, George’s partner, Fadi Fawaz, found him peacefully resting in bed.</p><p>This heartbreaking news devastated his manager, who received a call informing him of the discovery.
