He is easily recognized as an actor, but apart from his acting talents, he makes extra cash from his music career, business venture, TV presentation job, and entrepreneur.</p><p>Nay has had an amazing mixed career over the years. He has worked with notable people both within and outside the South African entertainment world. His talents have also taken him to places across the country. In fact, it’s been an awesome journey so far for the young man.</p><h2><strong>He Hails From Gauteng Province</strong></h2><p>Nay Maps calls Gauteng province home. He was born in the region, precisely in Pretoria, on the 30th of March, 1989. The actor was raised in his hometown, after which he left the area for greener pastures in the city.</p><p>Maps had his primary and secondary school education at Sunnyside Primary School and Lyttelton Manor High School, respectively, in Pretoria. He graduated from the University of Pretoria, where he studied Information technology, programming, and software.</p><p>Not much is known about his life before he became famous. However, it is believed that it was his love for arts that motivated him to make a career switch in his early days.</p><h2><strong>Nay Maps Has A Great Relationship With His Family</strong></h2><p>The actor is blessed with an amazing support system and lovely people in his life. His family has been supportive right from the beginning of his career, and they have never relented in proving their love for him.</p><p>Nathi is the son of Bishop Simeon Maphalala and his wife (her name is not known). The two are also parents to his only sisters Thando Pear Maphalala and Wandi Grace Maphalala. Unfortunately, Bishop Simeon passed away in July 2020 at the age of 59 from an undisclosed cause.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>RIP: Nay Maps’ father has died<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">#TheQueenMzansi</a> star’s father Bishop Simeon Maphalala passed over the weekend</p><p>He was 59 years old.</p><p>Condolences to Nay, his family and church’s congregation. ❤️<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">#PhilReports</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/DETJItSuVN</a></p><p>— Kgopolo (@PhilMphela) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">July 13, 2020</a></p><p>Until his death, he was a pastor and musician.</p><p>Nay’s sisters are all doing well for themselves, but they are not as famous as their celebrity brother. Thando is a musician and entrepreneur, while Wandi is a presenter, musician, and businesswoman.</p><h2><strong>A Look At The Actor’s Biggest Project And Journey To Greatness</strong></h2><p>Though Nay studied Information technology, programming, and software, he has always wanted to build a career in front of the camera. Obviously, he and his siblings inherited their music gene from their parents – Bishop Simeon’s wife has motivated the actor towards developing an undying love for music.</p><p>The particular age Maps launched his career is unknown. However, records show that he earned his breakthrough on television while presenting on the ANN7 channel lifestyle show, Hashtag.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/maps-1-e1621460057579.jpg><p>As an actor, the Pretoria native has appeared in several productions, including <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Uzalo</a> Season 1 – 4 (as Mxolisi Xulu), Impilo: The Scam – Season 1 (as Pacino), <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Isibaya</a> – Season 2 Tshepo (as Nay Maphalala), Skeem Saam – Season 8 as Mxolisi, as well as <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>The Queen</a> – Season 4 (as Dingane Khoza). His biggest project remains the South African TV series, Uzalo.&nbsp;The series brought so much fame and fortune on his way, and all the credit goes to his outstanding performance therein. Indeed, Mr. Maphalala put in his best in the project, and it panned out really nice.</p><p>His character (Xulu) is an unwilling young man who has to go on a journey of discovery from being a good boy to being the leader of his father’s shady business.&nbsp;Interestingly, Nay Maps has always done some modeling jobs and also made appearances in some commercials.</p><h2><strong>What Are Nay Maps’ Major Accomplishments?</strong></h2><p>If there is one thing Maps’ fans are certain of, it is the fact that his talents will one day pave the way for something bigger for him career-wise. The actor is yet to win any award for his roles in the entertainment industry. Still, we are not ruling out the possibility of that happening anytime soon – after all, he has the potentials, and he is good at what he does.</p><p>He was also part of the group that contested in season eight of the reality competition series Tropika Island of Treasure, which aired on SABC 3. He was featured as a celebrity contestant.</p><p lang=zxx dir=ltr><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/nPkmNay7bz</a></p><p>— Nay Maps (@NayMaps) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">February 6, 2021</a></p><p>Being a talented musician, Nay Maps has done the song cover of works by prominent musicians. Some of them include “Controller” by Drake and “Adorn” by Miguel. He has a keen interest in RnB, Soul, and Hip-hop, but he is yet to release any song for all his fans. The Pretoria-born actor plans to work with some big names in the South African music industry and drop some hits soonest. Besides singing, Maps is a great pianist.</p><p>Nay is also the CEO and founder of the clothing line Nay May Clothing. He launched the fashion business some time ago, and it has seen great growth so far. The actor’s clothing brand is located in Durban, but he s already expanding the business and establishing stores in other provinces.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaKyYmsCmecWamq2rXay2rbiMrZylpF2uvLZ5xK%2Bcq7Gknbavs4yamaitpGK7osWMppipq18%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthese-facts-will-tell-you-everything-about-nay-maps.html&text=Who%20is%20Nay%20Maps%3f%20All%20About%20The%20Actor%2c%20Musician%20and%20Presenter&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthese-facts-will-tell-you-everything-about-nay-maps.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthese-facts-will-tell-you-everything-about-nay-maps.html&title=Who%20is%20Nay%20Maps%3f%20All%20About%20The%20Actor%2c%20Musician%20and%20Presenter" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthese-facts-will-tell-you-everything-about-nay-maps.html&title=Who%20is%20Nay%20Maps%3f%20All%20About%20The%20Actor%2c%20Musician%20and%20Presenter" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthese-facts-will-tell-you-everything-about-nay-maps.html&title=Who%20is%20Nay%20Maps%3f%20All%20About%20The%20Actor%2c%20Musician%20and%20Presenter" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthese-facts-will-tell-you-everything-about-nay-maps.html&description=Who%20is%20Nay%20Maps%3f%20All%20About%20The%20Actor%2c%20Musician%20and%20Presenter" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./roberta-shore-age.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Roberta Shore?
