So these weight-loss rumors that have appeared out of nowhere just cannot be explained. Also, it's not like she's lost weight recently for people to be talking about it. Even if she did have weight changes, they were minor and unnoticeable because she has largely appeared to be the same weight and size for numerous years. The golfer is concerned with her own fitness and would never allow herself to become out of shape. Also her latest appearance doesn't show that difference.</p><p>Well, yes, it's true that she had a puffy face and a little tummy fat, which now seems to have gone away, which might be due to her weight loss. But this is not a huge kind of transformation. She has emerged as a favorable role model, particularly for aspiring young golfers. Her down-to-earth personality, paired with her unwavering commitment to the sport, has garnered her peers' respect and affection, and undoubtedly she has a huge fan following who wonders about her transformation.
