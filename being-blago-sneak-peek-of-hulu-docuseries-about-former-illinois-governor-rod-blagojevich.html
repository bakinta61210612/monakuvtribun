He’s been out of prison for 20 months. But he’s never been out of quips, quotes, and commentary.<p>“Being Blago” isn’t just a cute alliteration though. It’s what Illinois’ 40th governor does as a recovering ex-con, and is the given name of an ABC7 documentary dropping Friday on Hulu.</p><p>“Being Blago” has a complexion of its own. Beneath the pancake, powder, and now semi-restored hair color, are the intangibles many voters saw, and liked, sending Rod Blagojevich to the general assembly, Congress and twice to the Governor’s mansion; perhaps similar irrepressible traits that would eventually send him to federal prison.</p><p>“I was once on top of a very high mountain, I was knocked off of it, exiled,” Blagojevich told the I-Team.</p><p><b><a href=#>Richard Roeper reviews ‘Being Blago’</a></b></p><p>For a governor with much higher aspirations, the gates to political, legal and personal exile were officially unlocked with an announcement on December 9, 2008.</p><p>“Governor Blagojevich has been arrested in the middle of what we can only describe as a political corruption crime spree,” then U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald announced at a press conference.</p><p>Impeachment, two trials, a Trump commutation and eight years in prison later, Blagojevich’s flight from exile began as it had started: next to the same Chicago TV reporter, Chuck Goudie.</p><p><b><a href=#>Hear from the filmmakers of the ‘Being Blago’ documentary</a></b></p><p>Last May, the I-Team invited Blagojevich to reflect.</p><p>The interview blossomed into almost six months with Illinois’ latest defrocked governor; inside his home, inside his routine, inside his head — even inside his closet. And inside his marriage, from the woman who talked about being Blago’s wife.</p><p>“I hope there’s enough there underlying that we’ll find our way together again,” said Patti Blagojevich in the documentary.</p><p>These many interviews have resulted in a four-part ABC7 documentary, available Friday on Hulu, our Disney-partner streaming platform.</p><p>Hulu is among many things that have changed in the world while Blagojevich was in prison.</p><p>“I have a lot of catching up to do,” Blagojevich said. “You know, in prison, I was earning $5.25 a month, I went to college for that. I went to law school for that.”</p><p>He’s been working for a shipping company; has a podcast; is suing the state for preventing him from running for office and moonlights doing custom, online video greetings for anyone willing to pay.</p><p>“I charge $80. But I am the only governor and former inmate who does Cameos. So I am unique in that sense,” said Blagojevich. “I learned that even a governor in the fifth largest state in America can be taken out of office with fake crimes…they can do this to a sitting governor in America’s fifth largest state, they can do it to you.”</p><p>He says “they” include Patrick Fitzgerald, who was US Attorney on the Blago federal case.</p><p>“I think he has evil in him,” Blagojevich said. “I think he’s, I think he’s wicked.”</p><p>And Judge James Zagel, who sentenced Blagojevich to 14 years.</p><p>“I think he’s gonna have a day of judgment that he will have to answer for,” said Blagojevich.</p><p>And his political nemesis, Mike Madigan, Illinois’ longest-serving House Speaker who stepped down this year under the cloud of a corruption scandal.</p><p>“He’s ruthless, remorseless, and relentless, all of those things. But not everybody is all bad,” said Blagojevich.</p><p>He is unable to forget, and unwilling to forgive some who have contributed to his distress.</p><p>“You can’t lie to God. And I can’t say that I’ve forgiven them yet. But I don’t hate them,” Blagojevich told the I-Team.</p><p>Fitzgerald, Zagel and Madigan all declined to respond to Blagojevich’s quotes.</p><p>In our interview, he also quoted Winston Churchill, among many he cited in our lengthy interview.</p><p>Churchill said, “If we open a quarrel between the past and the present we shall find that we have lost the future.” Blagojevich promises that the future is his focus.</p><h2>Related Stories:</h2><p><b><a href=#>Rod Blagojevich says new lawsuit would open door to run for office</a></b></p><p><b><a href=#>Rod Blagojevich gives first interview from Chicago home, says his ‘conviction was wrong,’ thanks President Trump</a></b></p><p><b><a href=#>What Rod Blagojevich whispered on plane ride home from prison after sentence commuted</a></b></p><p><b><a href=#>Former Blagojevich aide recalls ‘bizarre’ days working for disgraced governor</a></b></p><p>Copyright © 2021 WLS-TV.
