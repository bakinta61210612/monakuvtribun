Calling her [Mariah] all kinds of bitches and hoes. I‚Äôm like; this is my wife. This is my new wife. I wrote a letter; first, I don‚Äôt even know if Twitter had come out yet. So, I wrote this long-a*s letter pretty much saying, look, I respect you as an artist. I‚Äôm actually a fan, and I think you‚Äôre one of the best ever to do it. But from man to man, you are talking out of pocket to my wife. You gotta be held accountable for that, so I need to see you face-to-face.‚Äù</p><p>And while Eminem has yet to respond to that comment, many of his fans have jumped to his defense, noting that this is just what the rapper does in general.</p><p>Meanwhile, Eminem seems to be dealing with some personal issues of his own, although the rapper has not shared any details on what is going on in his life. That has not stopped many of his supporters from speculating actively, however.</p><p>One person said: ‚ÄúHe was gone headbutt nick in true white boy fashion ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£. And the white boy would have won!‚Äù</p><p>Another commenter revealed: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm putting my money on Em. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è It‚Äôs sad that him and MC didn‚Äôt work out, but mad props for one of the most unproblematic divorces.‚Äù</p><p>This social media user explained: ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt need your help cause her comeback was flawless. The gag was Mariah diss him right back with Obsessed, Sooo no shade she didn‚Äôt need him to defend her ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.‚Äù</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Will Eminem respond to the drama?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeVoravscysZJudlZt6uLXToWSmmaKerql5wpqpnrGjYrK5ec2imqRlk5a7r7vNZqSin5ipeqmt1Z5km52Vo3qzscigpaKslZl6o7HCmqysnV2ks27Ax6KqZq6ZmbKweZJra3FtZGQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2feminems-beef-with-mariah-careys-ex-nick-cannon-might-have-been-reignited-because-of-this-video-324854.html&text=Eminems%20Beef%20With%20Mariah%20Careys%20Ex%2c%20Nick%20Cannon%2c%20Might%20Have%20Been%20Reignited%20Because%20Of%20This%20Vid&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feminems-beef-with-mariah-careys-ex-nick-cannon-might-have-been-reignited-because-of-this-video-324854.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2feminems-beef-with-mariah-careys-ex-nick-cannon-might-have-been-reignited-because-of-this-video-324854.html&title=Eminems%20Beef%20With%20Mariah%20Careys%20Ex%2c%20Nick%20Cannon%2c%20Might%20Have%20Been%20Reignited%20Because%20Of%20This%20Vid" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2feminems-beef-with-mariah-careys-ex-nick-cannon-might-have-been-reignited-because-of-this-video-324854.html&title=Eminems%20Beef%20With%20Mariah%20Careys%20Ex%2c%20Nick%20Cannon%2c%20Might%20Have%20Been%20Reignited%20Because%20Of%20This%20Vid" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2feminems-beef-with-mariah-careys-ex-nick-cannon-might-have-been-reignited-because-of-this-video-324854.html&title=Eminems%20Beef%20With%20Mariah%20Careys%20Ex%2c%20Nick%20Cannon%2c%20Might%20Have%20Been%20Reignited%20Because%20Of%20This%20Vid" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feminems-beef-with-mariah-careys-ex-nick-cannon-might-have-been-reignited-because-of-this-video-324854.html&description=Eminems%20Beef%20With%20Mariah%20Careys%20Ex%2c%20Nick%20Cannon%2c%20Might%20Have%20Been%20Reignited%20Because%20Of%20This%20Vid" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./10097567-espn-college-gameday-2023-tv-schedule-predictions-and-location-for-week-12.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="ESPN College Gameday 2023: TV Schedule, Predictions and Location for Week 12 | News, Scores, Highlig">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dupes-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=Dupes>Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
