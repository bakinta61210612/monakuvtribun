Both parties previously agreed that Moore would have primary custody of the child.</p><p>Related: <a href=#>Kenya Moore’s Estranged Husband Marc Daly Gets Dropped By Lawyer Weeks Before Heading to Trial, Reportedly Demands Moore’s House and Half Her Money</a></p><p>According to the outlet, he may also be eyeing stake in “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Real Housewives of Atlanta</a>” veteran’s custom-built home, nicknamed Moore Manor.</p><p>“The parties’ marital residence is located in Atlanta, Georgia at which wife and the child currently reside. Husband seeks an equitable division of the parties’ marital residence,” read the report.</p><p>In early May, Moore hit back at rumors that her estranged husband had any intentions of gunning for the house she has owned since 2015.</p><p>“The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Moore Manor</a> issue is not true, I can tell tell you that,” she told “Entertainment Tonight.” “I don’t know where that came from. I’m hoping that we leave the relationship with what we came in with it.”</p><p>The outcome of the trial will prove whether or request to block Daly from obtaining any ownership rights to the home is successful.</p><p>“I’m hoping that there’s a light [at the end of the tunnel]. I feel that there is, we’re in a much better place. We have a mediation coming up, and I think that we just both have to come together for the sake of our daughter, so we can just move on to co-parenting and not any drama with us,” she continued.</p><p>The entrepreneur added, “She [Brooklyn] deserves the very best, the very best father that she can have. I think once we put the divorce drama to bed, I think that he can focus on being a dad, and that’s what I’m looking forward to.”</p><p>Fans are supportive of their relationship ending, but many also were shocked and surprised by Daly’s demands.</p><p>One said, “I was just reading about @KenyaMoore divorce. That ex Marc really needs to get lost. He has the audacity to expect money from her and take whatever his grubby hands can get his hands on. No regard for his child. He is garbage. #RHOA.

My sole concern and focus is and will always be my daughter, Brooklyn, my miracle baby. She was made in love and true commitment. I ask for our privacy to be respected moving forward.”</p><p>Attempts to reconcile failed in 2020 failed. Moore later cited a breakdown in communication as one of their marriage’s foundational issues. She has long contested that Daly has been the source of holdups in their divorce. In April, it was reported that he had been dropped by his attorney. It is unclear if he has secured new counsel ahead of the impending trial, which starts in June.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the latest season of the Bravo reality series, the former video vixen is getting back into the swing of dating with Atlanta-based restaurant owner <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Roi Shlomo</a>.</p><p>“RHOA” airs Sunday nights at 8 p.m. ET.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX90e49uZmtvX6yybrrEnptmmV2srqrAyKeeZqyfYrK5tMClnGaln6Kyr8CMn5inq12Wv6Z50Z6YnbFdm7yzecqepbKZXaK8sL7EZpinnF2irrOvjJ2YpbGjYrGqws6rmp5lpKR6o7GMn6CnmZyex6awjJqqZp6fp7qmvoycpq6onJp6qbHAnapmrJ9iwbO1wKVm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwe-need-a-waiting-to-exhale-moment-fans-are-ready-for-kenya-moore-and-marc-dalys-divorce-to-be-finalized-as-former-couple-heads-to-trial.html&text=We%20Need%20a%20Waiting%20to%20Exhale%20Moment%3a%20Kenya%20Moores%20Estranged%20Husband%20Marc%20Daly%20Demands%20Stake%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwe-need-a-waiting-to-exhale-moment-fans-are-ready-for-kenya-moore-and-marc-dalys-divorce-to-be-finalized-as-former-couple-heads-to-trial.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwe-need-a-waiting-to-exhale-moment-fans-are-ready-for-kenya-moore-and-marc-dalys-divorce-to-be-finalized-as-former-couple-heads-to-trial.html&title=We%20Need%20a%20Waiting%20to%20Exhale%20Moment%3a%20Kenya%20Moores%20Estranged%20Husband%20Marc%20Daly%20Demands%20Stake%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwe-need-a-waiting-to-exhale-moment-fans-are-ready-for-kenya-moore-and-marc-dalys-divorce-to-be-finalized-as-former-couple-heads-to-trial.html&title=We%20Need%20a%20Waiting%20to%20Exhale%20Moment%3a%20Kenya%20Moores%20Estranged%20Husband%20Marc%20Daly%20Demands%20Stake%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwe-need-a-waiting-to-exhale-moment-fans-are-ready-for-kenya-moore-and-marc-dalys-divorce-to-be-finalized-as-former-couple-heads-to-trial.html&title=We%20Need%20a%20Waiting%20to%20Exhale%20Moment%3a%20Kenya%20Moores%20Estranged%20Husband%20Marc%20Daly%20Demands%20Stake%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwe-need-a-waiting-to-exhale-moment-fans-are-ready-for-kenya-moore-and-marc-dalys-divorce-to-be-finalized-as-former-couple-heads-to-trial.html&description=We%20Need%20a%20Waiting%20to%20Exhale%20Moment%3a%20Kenya%20Moores%20Estranged%20Husband%20Marc%20Daly%20Demands%20Stake%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-wants-ice-cream-response-2-wds-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who wants ice cream? response: 2 wds.">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./was-in-the-red-financially-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Was in the red financially">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
