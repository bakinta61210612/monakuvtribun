By founding the Novak Djokovic Foundation, he aims to give chances to children who cannot develop their full potential due to a lack of access to pre-primary education and good nutrition. Novak established the Novak Djokovic Foundation in 2007 in collaboration with the World Bank and UNICEF to assist poor Serbian children with the rights and opportunities they need to have a bright future and become contributing citizens worldwide.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Tara-Djokovic.jpeg><h2>She has more than enough time for her marriage.</h2><p>Tara is still a youngster enjoying her childhood with her wonderful family, so she has plenty of time to contemplate her marriage.&nbsp;Following her father’s Wimbledon triumph in 2014, her father and mother married.</p><h2>Her mother was expecting their first child with her father during their wedding.</h2><p>Her mother and father married after more than eight years of happy marriage. Their wedding was on July 10, 2014, at the Aman Sveti Stefan resort in Montenegro. During their wedding, her mother was pregnant with their first kid.</p><h2>She has one Elder brother.</h2><p>Stefan, her eldest brother, is just three years her senior. She spends much of her time playing with him. The brother-sister relationship seems to be endearing.&nbsp;Her brother arrived in the lovely World the same year their parents married. She is presently staying in Monte, Monaco, with her family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Tara-Djokovic-1.jpg><h2>Her parents have known one other since they were in high school.</h2><p>Her parents have known one other since they were in high school. They met at their High School Sports Academy in Serbia while playing tennis. They began dating after 13 years.</p><h2>A loving wife and mother</h2><p>She is fortunate to have a mother who dedicates her whole life to her family. Her mother, Jelena, has been a devoted wife to her husband and a devoted mother to Tara and her brother. Her mother and father like spending the most time with their children and are often seen posting images of them together on social media.</p><p>One of her father’s aspirations is to win a Grand Slam trophy in front of her and her brother, which he has been praying for. Her father could be heard praying as he accepted the prize in front of her brother Stefan. But her father is still waiting for the exact moment in front of her.</p><h2>Age</h2><p>Tara arrived in this beautiful World three years ago, in September 2017. Her father originally announced her birth on Instagram.<br>Her birthday was recently celebrated on September 2. However, her father could not attend her third birthday since he was in New York for the US Open.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>Tara has been working since she was a child. She is enjoying her billionaire father’s money as his daughter. Her father is the World’s No. 1 tennis player, having won multiple trophies. She contributes to her father’s hefty fortune. <strong>Tara Djokovic’s father’s net worth is $220 million as of December 2023.</strong></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Child</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirmqqRYrGru8qoraKbXaWus7HNrapmo56axG6xwJyfZqeknbKzecWrpqZlpJ2yqr6MoaCgoF2osKm7zqVknZmpqHw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftara-djokovic-parents-knew-each-other-from-their-high-school-days.html&text=Tara%20Djokovic%20Parents%20Knew%20Each%20Other%20From%20Their%20High%20School%20Days&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftara-djokovic-parents-knew-each-other-from-their-high-school-days.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftara-djokovic-parents-knew-each-other-from-their-high-school-days.html&title=Tara%20Djokovic%20Parents%20Knew%20Each%20Other%20From%20Their%20High%20School%20Days" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftara-djokovic-parents-knew-each-other-from-their-high-school-days.html&title=Tara%20Djokovic%20Parents%20Knew%20Each%20Other%20From%20Their%20High%20School%20Days" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftara-djokovic-parents-knew-each-other-from-their-high-school-days.html&title=Tara%20Djokovic%20Parents%20Knew%20Each%20Other%20From%20Their%20High%20School%20Days" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftara-djokovic-parents-knew-each-other-from-their-high-school-days.html&description=Tara%20Djokovic%20Parents%20Knew%20Each%20Other%20From%20Their%20High%20School%20Days" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./these-a-few-of-my-favorite-things-lyric-in-the-sound-of-music-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="These ___ a few of my favorite things ...
